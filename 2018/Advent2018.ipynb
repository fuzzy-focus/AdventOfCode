A value like `+6` means the current frequency increases by `6`; a value like `-3` means the current frequency decreases by `3`.\n",

    "The navigation system's license file consists of a list of numbers (your puzzle input). The numbers define a data structure which, when processed, produces some kind of [tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)) that can be used to calculate the license number.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *tree* is made up of *nodes*; a single, outermost node forms the tree's *root*, and it contains all other nodes in the tree (or contains nodes that contain nodes, and so on).\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, a node consists of:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   A *header*, which is always exactly two numbers:\n",
    "    -   The quantity of child nodes.\n",
    "    -   The quantity of metadata entries.\n",
    "-   Zero or more *child nodes* (as specified in the header).\n",
    "-   One or more *metadata entries* (as specified in the header).\n",

    "\n",
    "The first check done on the license file is to simply add up all of the metadata entries. In this example, that sum is `1+1+2+10+11+12+2+99=138`.\n",

    "However, if a node *does have child nodes*, the metadata entries become indexes which refer to those child nodes. A metadata entry of `1` refers to the first child node, `2` to the second, `3` to the third, and so on. The value of this node is the sum of the values of the child nodes referenced by the metadata entries. If a referenced child node does not exist, that reference is skipped. A child node can be referenced multiple time and counts each time it is referenced. A metadata entry of `0` does not refer to any child node.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, again using the above nodes:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Node `C` has one metadata entry, `2`. Because node `C` has only one child node, `2` references a child node which does not exist, and so the value of node `C` is `0`.\n",
    "-   Node `A` has three metadata entries: `1`, `1`, and `2`. The `1` references node `A`'s first child node, `B`, and the `2` references node `A`'s second child node, `C`. Because node B has a value of `33` and node `C` has a value of `0`, the value of node `A` is `33+33+0=66`.\n",
